## Question 

Q4) Write a user management project which will include;

• A master view which will list all users in a data grid. 
This screen will assist users with all CRUD operations. 
User will be able to press 3 buttons(New,Edit,Delete). 
Edit and Delete operations will require row selection from the data grid.

• A detailed view which will show the fields as form. 
Form will have 2 buttons (Action, Back). 
Text of the action button will change according to the operation opened the detail view.
 For example if the “New” operation is selected from the master, the detailed view action button text will be “Create”. Please see the mappings below.

▪ New: Create
▪ Edit: Save
▪ Delete: Delete
